README about me
 👋 Hey, I’m Vendelín Filip
 👀 I’m into anything from coding and programming through biotech, art, design, music to philosophy.
 🌱 I’m currently learning Dart for Flutter, Android development, project management and a lot more.
 💞️ I’m open to collaborate with anybody on anything, just text me. But mainly projects with a reason and a bigger idea.
